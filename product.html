    <p>
        The Basic Battery Rack Is A Power-Storing Device That Must Be Placed Indoors. It Can Store Up To 1,000kWs Of <a href="https://icarus.fandom.com/wiki/Electricity">Power </a>And Can Charge/Output Power At A Max Rate Of 1,500 Watts Per Second.
        Use An <a href="https://icarus.fandom.com/wiki/Electricity_Tool">Electricity Tool</a> To Connect It To <a href="https://icarus.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Benches">Benches</a> To Store/Provide Power. Basic Battery Racks Can Be Picked Up And Will Retain The Power Stored; Great For Small Outposts With Minimal Power Requirements, But More Are Needed For Bases With Larger Power Requirements.
    </p>
    <h2>Charge/Discharge Rate</h2>
    <p>
        Charge Rate Is Defined By The Total Excess Power Available, The Flow Rate For The Battery Itself, And The Number Of Batteries Connected To The Network. If There Are Multiple Batteries Connected To A Single Network, The Total Excess Is Divided Over All Batteries That Can Be Charged.
        <br>
        Ex: If A Network Is Producing 5000 Excess And There Are 4 Basic Battery Racks, The Charge Rate For Each Battery Will Be 1,250.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, The Discharge Rate Of Batteries Is Divided Among All Batteries Connected To A Network, Draining Each At An Equal Rate To Keep The Network Operational. If The Total Power Draw Is More Than The Batteries Can Handle, The Batteries Will Prioritize Power Output To Prioritized Deployables. To Choose Whether A Deployable Receives Power Priority, Press 'R' On A Spline Puck While Holding An <a href="https://icarus.fandom.com/wiki/Electricity_Tool">Electricity Tool</a> Or Press 'F' While Viewing The Electricity Network On A <a href="https://icarus.fandom.com/wiki/Flow_Meter">Flow Meter</a>, Left Click On The Desired Deployable In The Center List, And Check The Box Under Priority.

        <p>Rack-Mountable Equipment Is Traditionally Mounted By Bolting Or Clipping Its Front Panel To The Rack. Within The IT Industry, It Is Common For Network/Communications Equipment To Have Multiple Mounting Positions, Including Tabletop And Wall Mounting, So Rack-Mountable Equipment Will Often Feature L-Brackets That Must Be Screwed Or Bolted To The Equipment Prior To Mounting In A 19-Inch Rack. Equipment Designed To Be Placed In A Rack Is Typically Described As Rack-Mount, Rack-Mount Instrument, A Rack-Mounted System, A Rack-Mount Chassis, Subrack, Rack Cabinet, Rack-Mountable, Or Occasionally Simply Shelf.</p>
        <p>A 19-Inch Rack Is A Standardized Frame Or Enclosure For Mounting Multiple Electronic Equipment Modules. Each Module Has A Front Panel That Is 19 Inches (482.6 Mm) Wide. The 19 Inch Dimension Includes The Edges Or Ears That Protrude From Each Side Of The Equipment, Allowing The Module To Be Fastened To The Rack Frame With Screws Or Bolts. Common Uses Include Computer Servers, Telecommunications Equipment And Networking Hardware, Audiovisual Production Gear, Music Production Equipment, And Scientific Equipment.</p>

            A Rack Unit (Abbreviated U Or RU) Is A Unit Of Measure Defined As 1<sup>3/4</sup> Inches (44.45 Mm). It Is Most Frequently Used As A Measurement Of The Overall Height Of 
            <a href="#">19-Inch And 23-Inch Rack Frames</a>, As Well As The Height Of Equipment That Mounts In These Frames, Whereby The Height Of The Frame Or Equipment Is Expressed 
            As Multiples Of Rack Units. For Example, A Typical Full-Size Rack Cage Is 42U High, While Equipment Is Typically 1U, 2U, 3U, Or 4U High.

            Definition<br>
            The Rack Unit Size Is Based On A Standard Rack Specification As Defined In <a href="#">EIA-310</a>. The <a href="#">Eurocard</a> Specifies A Standard Rack Unit As The Unit Of Height; 
            It Also Defines A Similar Unit, Horizontal Pitch (HP), Used To Measure The Width Of Rack-Mounted Equipment. The Standard Was Adopted Worldwide As 
            <a href="#">IEC 60297 Mechanical Structures For Electronic Equipment – Dimensions Of Mechanical Structures Of The 482.6 Mm (19 In) Series</a>, 
            And Defines The Sizes For Rack, Subrack (A Shelf-Like Chassis In Which Cards Can Be Inserted), And The Pitch Of Printed Circuit Boards/Cards 
            Providing Physical Compatibility Of Technological Equipment, Typically In Telecommunications.

            <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
            <p>An indispensable element in the arrangement and administration of the diverse apparatuses employed in a closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring system is the CCTV rack. Here is a summary of its key attributes and parts:
               <li>Organisational goal: Maintains clean, well-maintained CCTV equipment.</li>
               <li>Accessibility: Offers simple access to parts for upkeep and modifications.</li>
                <li>	Security: Usually consists of locks to keep out unwanted visitors.</li>
                
                </p></div>
            <div class ="cable-con-2">
                <h2>1.	The structural framework known as the rack frame holds all of the equipment.</h2>
                <li >	2.	Shelves: Modular stands for servers, DVRs, NVRs, and other hardware.</li>
                    <li>3.	Fans or air vents are used in cooling systems to keep equipment from overheating</li>
                    <li>	4.	Power management: Surge protectors and power strips help control the electrical supply and prevent spikes in power</li>
                <li>	5.	Cable management: To elegantly arrange and route cables, use raceways, management panels, and cable ties.</li>
                <li>6.	Frequently Found Equipment Digital Video Recorders (DVRs): Used to save video from analogue cameras.</li>
                <h2>7.	Video footage from IP cameras can be recorded using network video recorders, or NVRs.</h2>
                <li>	8.	Monitors: For playing back and viewing video feeds in real time.</li>
                <li>9.	Routers and switches: for network access.</li>

            <p>OFC accessories will be manufactured by PHEDEL ENTERPRISES INC. 
                An assembly resembling an electrical cable but with one or more optical fibres used for light transmission within is called a fibre-optic cable, sometimes referred to as an optical fibre cable. Generally, the optical fibre elements are housed in a protective tube appropriate for the environment in which the cable is used and separately coated with plastic layers. Fiber-optic communication uses a variety of cables for various purposes, such as long-distance telecommunication or high-speed data connections between various areas of a facility.
                We are manufacturing Joint Closures, Pig Tails, Patch Cords, Splitters, Patch panels, Splice trays, LIUs and FDMS Trays etc..

            <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
            <p>HDPE withstands a variety of climatic conditions and finds use in situations requiring low-cost, long-lasting fluid pipe systems. PE [polyethylene] pipe has been used for water and other fluids throughout Europe and America since the 1950s, according to a news release from the Plastics Pipe Institute. This is because of its long-term cost-effectiveness, corrosion resistance, durability, and leak-free joints.
